Spoken by the Latino-Faliscan people of Italy who lived there from the early 1st millennium BC.

Latin and Faliscan belong to the group, as well as two others often considered dialects of archaic Latin:[citation needed] Lanuvian and Praenestine.

As the power of Ancient Rome grew, Latin absorbed elements of the other languages and replaced Faliscan. The other variants went extinct as Latin became dominant. Latin in turn developed via Vulgar Latin into the Romance languages, now spoken by more than 800 million people, largely as a result of the influence of the Roman Empire initially, and in later times the Spanish, French and Portuguese Empires.
