# Orthographic rules -JS

### Case and width

1. Case sensitivity is distinguished.
2. Full-width and half-width characters are distinguished.
3. Half-width spaces, tabs (indents), and line breaks (if between sentences, they help distinguish different sentences) are ignored.

### `;` and line break

1. `;` is used to separate sentences on the same line.
2. If there is a line break between sentences, it is considered a different sentence even without `;`.

### Commenting out (in VS Code or Cursor, use `CMD`+`/`)

1. Single line `//`
2. Multi-line `/* */`
