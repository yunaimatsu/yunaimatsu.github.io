  - ELF: Executable and Linkable Format (standard binary format on Linux)
  - 64-bit: Runs on 64-bit architecture
  - LSB: Least Significant Byte first (little-endian byte order)
  - pie executable: Position Independent Executable (can be loaded at any memory address for security/ASLR)
  - x86-64: Intel/AMD 64-bit instruction set
  - version 1 (SYSV): ELF version 1, System V ABI
  - dynamically linked: Uses shared libraries (not statically compiled)
  - interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: Dynamic linker that loads shared libraries at runtime
  - BuildID[sha1]=...: Unique identifier for this build
  - for GNU/Linux 4.4.0: Minimum kernel version required
  - stripped: Debug symbols removed (smaller file, harder to debug)
