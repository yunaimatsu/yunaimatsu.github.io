Technical Differences Between vi, vim, and nvim (Neovim)ðŸ”¹ 1. vi (Visual Editor)Original text editor on UNIX systems (1976).Developed by Bill Joy as part of BSD Unix.Typically very minimal, lacks modern features.Available by default on nearly every Unix-like system.No syntax highlighting, no plugins, no undo tree.Implementation differences:Not standardized: vi on Linux might be a symlink to vim -C (compatible mode) or even a different implementation (like BusyBox's vi).Use case: Emergency or minimal environments.ðŸ”¹ 2. vim (Vi IMproved)Developed by Bram Moolenaar, started in 1991.A superset of vi â€” all vi commands work in vim.Adds many modern features:Multiple levels of undo/redoSyntax highlightingSplit windows, tabsExtended configuration (.vimrc)Plugins (with .vim scripts)Backward compatible with vi using vim -C.Use case: General-purpose modern terminal text editing.ðŸ”¹ 3. nvim (Neovim)A modern fork of vim started in 2014.Main goals:Refactor legacy vim codebaseImprove extensibility, asynchronous job control, UI separationMajor differences:Built-in LSP client (Language Server Protocol)Native tree-sitter support for better syntax parsingLua scripting support (faster and more modern than VimL)Better plugin architecture (async & remote plugins)UI is decoupled: allows GUIs or TUI frontends to interact over a msgpack RPC APIConfiguration uses .config/nvim/init.lua (or .vim).Use case: Modern power users and developers needing a fast, extensible editor.Your Neovim TasksBased on your todo list, here are some helpful commands and information:List Buffers (Drafts) in Neovim:ls        " List all buffers
:buffers   " Alternative command
:files     " Another alternativeList Shortcuts (Remaps) in Neovim:map       " Show all mappings
:nmap      " Show normal mode mappings
:imap      " Show insert mode mappings
:vmap      " Show visual mode mappings
:verbose map <key>  " Show detailed info about a specific mappingKey Bindings for Your Commands-- In your init.lua, add these keymaps:
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ps", ":PackerSync<CR>", { desc = "Packer Sync" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>mp", ":MarkdownPreview<CR>", { desc = "Markdown Preview" })Understanding .local/share/....local/share/nvim/ is where Neovim stores user dataPlugin data, logs, and state files are stored hereCommon locations:~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/ - Plugin installations~/.local/share/nvim/log/ - Log files~/.local/share/nvim/swap/ - Swap filesNeovim Log Files Location# Check log files
ls ~/.local/share/nvim/log/
# Or within Neovim:
:echo stdpath('log')Background Process Output IssueYour solution is correct. To prevent background process logs from appearing in Neovim:# Best approaches:
nohup some_command > /dev/null 2>&1 &
some_command > ~/background.log 2>&1 &This redirects both stdout and stderr away from your terminal, preventing the output from interfering with Neovim's display.
