# **"UDF"** typically stands for **Universal Disk Format**.

**UDF** is a file system standard developed by the Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA) primarily for optical media like **CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs**, though it can also be used on other types of storage devices.

So, **"udftool"** is likely a tool designed to **create, manipulate, or inspect UDF file systems**. It might allow users to:

* Create UDF-formatted images
* Extract or insert files
* Modify UDF metadata
* Inspect UDF structures for debugging or forensic purposes

If you need specifics about what a particular `udftool` does (since the name could be reused in different software contexts), I can look it up for you. Just let me know what operating system or project you're referring to.
