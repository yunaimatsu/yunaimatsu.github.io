# Assembly language in general

Assembly language serves several important purposes in computer programming and systems development, despite being considered low-level compared to modern high-level languages.

### Hardware-Oriented

**Hardware Control**

- **Direct Interaction with Hardware:** Assembly language allows programmers to directly interact with a computer's hardware. This is essential for writing firmware, device drivers, and other low-level software where precise control over hardware components like CPU, memory, and peripherals is required.
- **Embedded Systems:** Many embedded systems, such as microcontrollers, are programmed using assembly language because of the need for tight control over the hardware and minimal use of resources.
- **Bootstrapping:** Assembly language is used for writing the initial code that runs when a computer is powered on, such as BIOS or firmware, which sets up the environment for the operating system to load.
- **Custom Instruction Sets:** When working with custom hardware or processors with non-standard instruction sets, assembly language is often required since there may not be a high-level language compiler available.

**System Software Development**

- **Operating Systems:** Assembly language is often used in developing operating systems, particularly for writing kernel code, boot loaders, and low-level routines that must run directly on the hardware without the overhead of a higher-level language.

### Advantages of the Language Itself

**Efficiency**

- **Optimized Performance:** By controlling hardware directly, assembly language can achieve highly optimized performance, which is crucial in systems where efficiency and speed are critical (e.g., real-time systems, embedded systems).
- **Efficient Memory Usage:** It enables efficient use of memory and CPU resources, which is vital in resource-constrained environments, such as embedded systems or early computing platforms with limited memory and processing power.
- **Inline Assembly:** Some high-level languages allow embedding assembly code directly within the source code, giving programmers the ability to optimize specific parts of the code without writing an entire program in assembly.

**Granularity and Precision**

- **Fine-Grained Control:** Assembly language provides **detailed control** over the CPUâ€™s operations, allowing programmers to optimize code down to individual instructions and cycles. This is useful in scenarios where the timing of operations must be finely tuned.
- **Critical Performance Sections:** In some high-performance applications, assembly language is used in conjunction with high-level languages like C or C++ **to write critical sections of code that require maximum performance**, such as algorithms used in cryptography, graphics rendering, or signal processing.
    - High-level programming languages which allow embedding assembly
        - 1. **C**
            - **Inline Assembly:** C allows embedding assembly code using the `asm` or `__asm__` keyword (GCC/Clang) or `_asm` (MSVC).
            - **Example:**
                
                ```c
                int sum(int a, int b) {
                    int result;
                    asm("add %1, %2; mov %0, %1" : "=r"(result) : "r"(a), "r"(b));
                    return result;
                }
                ```
                
        - 2. **C++**
            - **Inline Assembly:** Like C, C++ supports inline assembly using the `asm` or `__asm__` keyword.
            - **Example:**
                
                ```cpp
                int sum(int a, int b) {
                    int result;
                    __asm__ ("add %[a], %[b]\\n\\t"
                             "mov %[result], %[a]"
                             : [result] "=r" (result)
                             : [a] "r" (a), [b] "r" (b)
                             );
                    return result;
                }
                ```
                
        - 3. **Rust**
            - **Inline Assembly (Nightly):** Rust provides inline assembly with the `asm!` macro, available in the nightly compiler as of now.
            - **Example:**
                
                ```rust
                fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
                    let result: i32;
                    unsafe {
                        asm!(
                            "add {0}, {1}",
                            inout(reg) a => result,
                            in(reg) b,
                        );
                    }
                    result
                }
                ```
                
        - 4. **Swift**
            - **Inline Assembly (Limited):** Swift allows embedding assembly via the `__asm__` keyword, but it is platform-specific (e.g., ARM on Apple platforms).
            - **Example:**
                
                ```swift
                func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
                    var result: Int = 0
                    __asm__ (
                        "add %[result], %[a], %[b]"
                        : [result] "=r" (result)
                        : [a] "r" (a), [b] "r" (b)
                    )
                    return result
                }
                ```
                
        - 5. **Objective-C**
            - **Inline Assembly:** Since Objective-C is a superset of C, it supports inline assembly using `asm` or `__asm__`.
            - **Example:**
                
                ```objectivec
                int sum(int a, int b) {
                    int result;
                    __asm__ volatile("addl %%ebx, %%eax" : "=a"(result) : "a"(a), "b"(b));
                    return result;
                }
                ```
                
        - 6. **Go**
            - **Linking to Assembly Files:** Go does not natively support inline assembly, but it allows linking to external assembly files written in Go assembly syntax.
            - **Example:**
                - You write assembly in a separate `.s` file and call it from Go code.
        - 7. **D**
            - **Inline Assembly:** D language has a built-in `asm` block that allows embedding assembly code.
            - **Example:**
                
                ```c
                int sum(int a, int b) {
                    int result;
                    asm {
                        add EAX, EBX;
                        mov result, EAX;
                    }
                    return result;
                }
                
                ```
                
        - 8. **Nim**
            - **Inline Assembly:** Nim provides inline assembly through the `asm` statement.
            - **Example:**
                
                ```
                proc add(a: int, b: int): int =
                    asm """
                    add $1, $2
                    mov $0, $1
                    """[result, a, b]
                
                ```
                
        - 9. **Pascal (Delphi)**
            - **Inline Assembly:** Delphi (Object Pascal) supports inline assembly using the `asm` block.
            - **Example:**
                
                ```pascal
                function Add(A, B: Integer): Integer;
                asm
                  MOV EAX, A
                  ADD EAX, B
                end;
                ```
                
        - 10. **Ada**
            - **Inline Assembly:** Ada supports embedding assembly with the `Assembler` package.
            - **Example:**
                
                ```
                procedure Add is
                   A, B, Result : Integer;
                begin
                   Assembler ("ADD %0, %1", Output => Result, Inputs => (A, B));
                end Add;
                ```

- **Legacy Code Maintenance**
    - **Supporting Older Systems:** Many older systems and software were written in assembly language. Maintaining, updating, or integrating with these systems often requires knowledge of assembly.
- **Educational Value**
    - **Understanding Computer Architecture:** Learning assembly language helps programmers understand how computers execute instructions at the hardware level. This knowledge is foundational for understanding more complex concepts in computer science, such as operating systems, compilers, and CPU design.
    - **Debugging and Reverse Engineering:** Understanding assembly is crucial for debugging at the machine level, especially when dealing with crashes or security vulnerabilities. It is also used in reverse engineering software to understand how a program works internally.
