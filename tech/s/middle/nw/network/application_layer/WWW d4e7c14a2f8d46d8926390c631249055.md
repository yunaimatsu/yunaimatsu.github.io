The World Wide Web has transformed the way we access and share information. It allows people to easily access and share information and media from all over the world. Through the World Wide Web, people can communicate, learn, collaborate, and conduct business in ways that were once impossible.
The World Wide Web is made up of millions of websites, which are hosted on servers all around the world. Websites can contain text, images, audio, video, and other types of content. Users can access websites using a web browser, which is a software application that retrieves and displays web pages.
Overall, the World Wide Web has had a profound impact on society, revolutionizing the way we interact with each other and the world around us.
