[happy, sad, excited, sick]: Each position represents context. 

[1,0,1,0]: We have no value in sad and sick, we full value on happy and excited, we a positive context. 

# Cosine Simmilarity

Cosine similarity use the angle of two vector to represents similarity.

- If θ = 0°, the ‘x’ and ‘y’ vectors overlap, thus proving they are similar.
- If θ = 90°, the ‘x’ and ‘y’ vectors are dissimilar, the embedding meaning does not interact.

Why $\theta$ ?

- The distance is the same even if you stretch the vector length. It is independent from the vector value.
- It can has many dimension as possible. It is independent from the dimension number.
