## `null` and `undefined`

- **`null`**: It is an intentional absence of any object value. It's an assignment value that can be assigned to a variable to indicate that it has no value.
- **`undefined`**: This means that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It can also mean that a property does not exist or that a function does not return a value.

not directly stored in the memory location of a variable, but rather hold a reference to the memory location where the data is actually stored.
