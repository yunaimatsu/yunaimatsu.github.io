Executable: Yes

- Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects and can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

A special type of object that is callable.

the main difference between function and the other object is whether it can be executed (executable objects have `()` at the end).

`function(){}`
