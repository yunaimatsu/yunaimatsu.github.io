# XML

Creating XML Documents:You can create XML documents using a text editor or specialized XML editors. Simply structure your data using elements, attributes, and text content.

Parsing XML Documents:In programming, you'll often need to parse XML documents to work with the data. Popular programming languages offer libraries or built-in features for parsing XML.

In Python, you can use the built-in xml module or libraries like ElementTree or lxml.

In Java, the javax.xml.parsers package provides classes for parsing XML, and third-party libraries like Apache Xerces are also available.

Accessing XML Data:Once you've parsed an XML document, you can access its data using the programming language's features for traversing and manipulating data structures. For example, in Python's ElementTree, you can use methods like find(), findall(), and properties like .text to access XML elements and their content.
