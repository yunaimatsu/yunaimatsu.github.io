A use case diagram is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that visually represents the interactions between users (actors) and a system. It helps to define the functional requirements of a system by showing how users interact with it.

Key Components of a Use Case Diagram

1. Actors – Represent users or external systems that interact with the system (e.g., customer, admin, payment gateway).


2. Use Cases – Represent specific functionalities or tasks that the system provides (e.g., "Login", "Make Payment").


3. System Boundary – Defines the scope of the system, indicating what is included and excluded.


4. Relationships – Show connections between actors and use cases. These include:

Association (solid line) – Represents an interaction between an actor and a use case.

Include (dashed arrow with <<include>>) – Indicates that a use case is always called within another use case.

Extend (dashed arrow with <<extend>>) – Indicates that a use case is conditionally added to another use case.




Example Use Case Diagram

For an Online Shopping System, a simple use case diagram might include:

Actors: Customer, Admin

Use Cases: Browse Products, Add to Cart, Make Payment, Manage Orders

Relationships:

The Customer can "Browse Products" and "Make Payment."

"Make Payment" includes "Enter Payment Details."

"Manage Orders" extends "Make Payment" (e.g., only if payment is successful).



Use case diagrams help in software development by clarifying system behavior, aiding communication between stakeholders, and serving as a foundation for further design and documentation.
