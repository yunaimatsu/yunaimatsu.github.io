In .md (Markdown) files, naming conventions depend on the project type, platform, and organizational preferences. Here are common naming conventions for .md files:

General Naming Conventions

1. Lowercase with Hyphens (Recommended for Web & Git Repos)

✅ getting-started.md

✅ project-overview.md

Reason: Hyphens improve readability and compatibility with URLs.



2. Snake Case (Common in Some Codebases)

✅ getting_started.md

✅ project_overview.md

Reason: Easy to read and works well with underscores in programming environments.



3. PascalCase or CamelCase (Less Common, Used in Some Projects)

✅ GettingStarted.md

✅ ProjectOverview.md

Reason: More readable but less commonly used in Markdown files.




Special Naming Patterns

Best Practices

Use lowercase and hyphens for better readability (file-name.md).

Be descriptive to indicate file content (setup-guide.md instead of doc1.md).

Use standard names for project documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md).

Avoid spaces (use hyphens or underscores instead).
